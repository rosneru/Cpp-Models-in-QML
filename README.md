Tutorial which I followed at the topic QML, QtQuick and C++. A simple 
to-do list app is created.

[Tutorial video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BcAYDlpuT8 "Using C++ Models in QML")

The tutorial shows how an user interface is designed with QML using 
QtQuick controls and a C++ model is bound on later.


### Development environment ###

* Windows 10 Professional
* Qt Creator 4.7.0
* Qt 5.11.1
* C++ - Compiler of Visual Studio 2017
* C++ - Debugger CDB of Windows 10 SDK 

For holding the sources compatible to current Debian Stretch 
distributions only QtQuick controls at version 2.7 (instead of 2.11) 
have been used.
